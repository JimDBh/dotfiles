# Kakoune configuration

Fancy screenshot for you: ![Kakoune][0]

Kakoune is amazing code editor, with multiple cursors as a central way of
interaction with text. It was inspired by Vim, and I quite like it. Currently it
is my favorite editor. I've configured it for my needs, but if you find this
configuration useful feel free to use and modify it for your needs.

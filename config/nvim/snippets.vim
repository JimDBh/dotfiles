" Some notes about snippets:
" There are 3 categories for now:
	" 1. Normal mode snippets.
	" Snippet begins with comma and ends with Tab keypress.
	" Basically the simplest one out there to use, all you need is to
	" type ,snippetName and hit Tab to expand it. Cursor will be placed
	" accordingly to snippet context, and mode will be changed to insert

	" 2. Insert mode snippets. 
	" Snippets that are just abbreviations, yet a snippet with some cursor 
	" positioning.

	" 3. Insert mode interactive snippets.
	" These snippets are abbreviations too, but they end with a '/' symbol. 
	" The complicated part to understand is that these snippets must be ended 
	" with double press of '/' button: first press is part of abbreviation and
	" the second one is part of ':%s///g' command that is executed at the end.
	" This command will be used to replace all template names in the snippet to 
	" desired one.

" Snippet files are located in ~/.vim/snippets/

" Snippets

	" Creates empty class template with public constructor and
	" virtual destructor, and empty private section
	" usage: in insert mode type class and press / twice e.g class//
	" It will expand class in that line and search for template _Class_Name_
	" in the class, and promt you a :%s///g command where you can type a class name
	" so it could be set automatically

	" This is total mess. Don't try this at home. Requires ninja skills.
	" Generates getter and setter for C++ private class items.
	" Input  format: type name;
	" Output format: type obtainName() {return name;}
	"                void establishName(type Name) {name = Name;}
	" For example: 'unsigned char* letter;' will produce:
	" unsigned char* obtainLetter() {return letter;}
	" void establishLetter(unsigned char* Letter) {letter = Letter;}
	" just above 'private:' keyword
	" You can change function names in this string only
	" Search for hiobtain and hiestablish and change
	" to higet hiset or to any hi* pattern
	" WARNING: must be used below 'private' keyword in a class scope

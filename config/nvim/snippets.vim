" Some Notes About Snippets:
"	There are 4 categories for now:
"	1. Normal mode snippets:
"	   Snippet begins with comma and ends with Tab keypress.
"	   Basically the simplest one out there to use, all you need is to
"	   type ,snippetName and hit Tab to expand it. Cursor will be placed
"	   accordingly to snippet context, and mode will be changed to insert
"
"	2. Insert mode snippets:
"	   Snippets that are just abbreviations, yet a snippet with some cursor
"	   positioning.
"
"	3. Insert mode interactive snippets:
"	   These snippets are abbreviations too, but they end with a '/' symbol.
"	   The complicated part to understand is that these snippets must be ended
"	   with double press of '/' button: first press is part of abbreviation and
"	   the second one is part of ':%s///g' command that is executed at the end.
"	   This command will be used to replace all template names in the snippet to
"	   desired one.
"
"	4. *NEW* snippets with placeholders *NEW*
"	   I bet you never seen such stupid thing in your life. This snippets
"	   contain special markers, that can be jumped at. Markers are listed
"	   below:
"          a) ${1: }    - empty placeholder
"          b) ${1:text} - placeholder containing standard text entry
"
"      When jump preformed with <c-j> (usable from any mode, be careful) the
"      mapping will automatically delete all unnecessary symbols, and will
"      leave you with placeholder text selected in visual mode. You can press
"      `c` to modify it, or jump to next placeholder if you satisfied wit
"      standard placeholder's text. Examples can be found on line 80 or just
"      search for \<" for,\> pattern
"
"	Snippet files are located in ~/.vim/snippets/ and named *.vim

" C Snippets

	" Creates empty class template with public constructor and
	" virtual destructor, and empty private section
	"
	" USAGE: in insert mode type class and press / twice e.g class//
	"
	" It will expand class in that line and search for template _Class_Name_
	" in the class, and promt you a :%s///g command where you can type a class name
	" so it could be set automatically. Cursor is positioned automatically in
	" repace command.

	" Generates getter and setter for C++ private class items.
	" Input  Format: type name;
	" Output Format: type obtainName() {return name;}
	"                void establishName(type Name) {name = Name;}
	"
	" For example: 'unsigned char* letter;' will produce:
	" unsigned char* obtainLetter() {return letter;}
	" void establishLetter(unsigned char* Letter) {letter = Letter;}

	" just above 'private:' keyword
	" You can change function names in this string only
	" Search for hiobtain and hiestablish and change
	" to higet hiset or to any hi* pattern
	" WARNING: must be used below 'private' keyword in a class scope

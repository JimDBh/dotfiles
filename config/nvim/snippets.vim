" Some Notes About Snippets:
"	There are 3 categories for now:
"	1. Normal mode snippets:
"	   Snippet begins with comma and ends with Tab keypress.
"	   Basically the simplest one out there to use, all you need is to
"	   type ,snippetName and hit Tab to expand it. Cursor will be placed
"	   accordingly to snippet context, and mode will be changed to insert
"
"	2. Insert mode snippets:
"	   Snippets that are just abbreviations, yet a snippet with some cursor
"	   positioning.
"
"	3. Insert mode interactive snippets:
"	   These snippets are abbreviations too, but they end with a '/' symbol.
"	   The complicated part to understand is that these snippets must be ended
"	   with double press of '/' button: first press is part of abbreviation and
"	   the second one is part of ':%s///g' command that is executed at the end.
"	   This command will be used to replace all template names in the snippet to
"	   desired one.
"
"	Snippet files are located in ~/.vim/snippets/

" C Snippets

	" Creates empty class template with public constructor and
	" virtual destructor, and empty private section
	"
	" USAGE: in insert mode type class and press / twice e.g class//
	"
	" It will expand class in that line and search for template _Class_Name_
	" in the class, and promt you a :%s///g command where you can type a class name
	" so it could be set automatically. Cursor is positioned automatically in
	" repace command.

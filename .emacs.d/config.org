This  is my  Emacs configuration  file written  as Org  document.  The
purpose of  this file  is to  provide convenient  way to  browse Emacs
configuration  with  expressive  comments,  and  references  to  other
people's work.

* Why Emacs?
Emacs by nature  is really powerful editor, that can  do anything from
playing [[https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/d0e2a341dd9a9a365fd311748df024ecb25b70ec/lisp/play/tetris.el][Tetris]]  to [[https://github.com/CestDiego/sweetgreen.el][Ordering  Salads]], but  as any  kind of  power, this
comes at a cost.  In case of Emacs the cost is  time.  Making Emacs as
feature full as most modern  editors, like Sublime Text, Visual Studio
Code, and  Atom, can  take huge  amount of time,  because you  need to
search over the internet for the packages, that provide this and that.

If Atom or VS Code already have all of this plus more why not just use
those editors instead of Emacs? Well,  first of all, they are built on
top  of [[https://electronjs.org/][Electron]]  framework, which  has some  /problems/. It  constantly
improves, but still  it is enormously fat for text  editor. If I would
use  windows,  I  would  choose  to use  VS  Code,  since  there's  no
alternative  actually.  Well,  I  could  use Emacs  there,  but it  is
unpleasant experience. What's  actually good about VS Code  or Atom is
that they have all functionality within themselves.  For example,
recursive search for a  file, I can do it with  atom without any extra
tool like  =find=, but not  in Emacs. This isn't  a problem in  Linux or
Mac OS  though, due it's  Unix nature. It's  even better, since  I can
replace these  tools with  more performant tools  like [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]]  or [[https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep][ripgrep]],
which would be hard to achieve in Windows.

I've  avoided  Sublime  Text  in previous  paragraph,  because  it  is
actually performant, and features everything that other editors offer,
but unfortunately it's not free. I don't  mind to pay for a good tool,
but I don't  think that software has  to be closed source  in order to
get funding.  I  understand that closed source  software gets payments
more often, because you can't use  it without paying, and Sublime Text
is  actually a  great  editor, but  still, I  prefer  free tools  when
possible.

OK,  what about  terminal editors  like Vim?  It is  highly extensible
editor, it's fast, and is available  on all systems.  That's true, but
there's a problem I  can't live with. Neovim. At first I  was a fan of
Vim  and  Neovim competition,  thinking  that  Neovim can  bring  long
awaited features, and fix major problems  with Vim, but after using it
for  several years  I've  realized  that it  brought  mostly bugs  and
incompatibilities. Yeah, the  features were neat, but  for some reason
Vim started  implementing these  new features in  its own  way, making
them incompatible with Neovim's. Which resulted in plugins having half
backed support  of both editors. At  this point I was  struggling with
snippets, intelligent completion, certain UI plugins.  Maybe currently
situation is better, I don't know. And I don't want to know, actually.

Given that I don't want to turn Emacs  to Vim copy. I want Emacs to be
Emacs.  If  I wanted  to use  Vim I'd use  Vim. Although  there's also
Kakoune,  which is  great alternative  to  Vim. If  you need  terminal
editor that  is fast  and minimalist, yet  provides many  features via
POSIX tools, check it out.

Emacs  is hard,  it has  lame keybindings,  you need  to do  a lot  of
tinkering  in  order to  get  it  work how  you  like,  it has  bigger
footprint compared  to Vim, but still  it is a great  editor with huge
community.

* About this document
This file is  my actual configuration file for Emacs.   I do all edits
here, then /compile/  it to =.el= file. It is  convenient because Emacs is
complex tool, so I  can leave comments by myself, but  I don't need to
keep track over two files, like in Kakoune or Vim, since this document
is my configuration file and a bunch of notes simultaneously.

I try to  maintain my Emacs configuration simple and  small keeping as
much of  vanilla Emacs behaviors  as I can, but  I'm a sane  person so
some aspects which are actually insane in my opinion are changed. Like
for example, why  on Earth Emacs scrolls buffer by  chunks? It already
has =C-v= and  =A-v= for this. Anyway, I'll make  explicit annotation if I
change something so it won't be hard to notice.

Now to the configuration itself.

* Configuration
As  I've  mentioned  earlier,  I'm  using  Org  Mode  function  called
=org-babel-tangle= to  build my =init.el=  file. This means that  you only
need  this  file  in order  to  get  my  config  and compile  it  with
=org-babel-tangle= function for  the first time. After  that, every time
this file is edited and  saved it gets re-tangled automatically.

Since I'm  trying to  follow Emacs conventions,  good Emacs  Lisp file
starts with commentary:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;;; init.el --- Emacs main configuration file -*- lexical-binding: t; -*-
  ;;;
  ;;; Commentary:
  ;;; Emacs config by Andrey Orst.
  ;;; This file was automatically generated by `org-babel-tangle'.
  ;;; Do not change this file.  Main config is located in .emacs.d/config.org
  ;;;
  ;;; Code:
#+END_SRC

After this  point configurations will  be split in  different sections
grouped by something in common to them all.

** Startup
Emacs starts slow, and  I like to close it when I'm  not using it. I'm
not closing and  opening it for every file, of  like every 15 minutes,
but still, the faster it starts - the better for me.

Once I switch  to Emacs 27 most  of these settings will  be tangled to
=early-init.el=.

*** Garbage collection and file handler
The  main  problem  with  Emacs startup  file  is  garbage  collection
system. It invoked  so many times on startup that  it causes quite big
impact on  startup time.  We're talking /seconds/.  One can  raise limit
when to trigger garbage collection, but this will end up in unpleasant
editing experience. So I'm declaring  these variables to store default
values for the GC, to restore them after initialization is finished:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar my--gc-cons-threshold gc-cons-threshold)
  (defvar my--gc-cons-percentage gc-cons-percentage)
  (defvar my--file-name-handler-alist file-name-handler-alist)
#+END_SRC

Now we can tweak GC. We need to raise threshold to prevent it running:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq gc-cons-threshold 402653184
        gc-cons-percentage 0.6
        message-log-max 16384
        auto-window-vscroll nil
        package-enable-at-startup nil
        file-name-handler-alist nil)
#+END_SRC

We need a hook that restores initial values once initialization done:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook
            (lambda ()
              (setq gc-cons-threshold my--gc-cons-threshold
                    gc-cons-percentage my--gc-cons-percentage
                    file-name-handler-alist my--file-name-handler-alist)))
#+END_SRC

*** =package.el= initialization
Doom Emacs  uses this  to speedup initialization,  so I'll  include it
too.   In   the  Doom  Emacs   Wiki  it  is  stated   that  Package.el
initialization is expensive.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil
        package--init-file-ensured t)
#+END_SRC

Melpa is a  package repository, that I use to  get packages. Since all
packages that  I need can  be obtained  from there, I  didn't bothered
with different methods of installation.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'package)
  (setq package-enable-at-startup nil)
  (add-to-list 'package-archives
               '("melpa" . "https://melpa.org/packages/") t)
#+END_SRC

Note for Windows users: change =https= to =http=

This basic  piece of code  is used to  update package list  if there's
none.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (package-initialize)
  (when (not package-archive-contents)
    (package-refresh-contents))
#+END_SRC

** Default Behavior Fixes
Emacs is  old. I  understand that  back then  it could  be appropriate
decisions,  but as  of today  they are  completely obliterated  by the
passage of time.

I'm not  trying to  insult on anyone,  but usage of  the bell  is just
insane. It's  not 1980's, computers  have their own speakers  and rich
displays, why would anyone want  to use builtin speaker?  Why everyone
should know when I'm mistaken? Disable bell.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq ring-bell-function 'ignore)
#+END_SRC

I don't  know who decided  that having backups  all over the  place is
good idea, but I don't think alike.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq backup-by-copying t
        create-lockfiles nil
        backup-directory-alist '(("." . "~/.cache/emacs-backups"))
        auto-save-file-name-transforms '((".*" "~/.cache/emacs-backups" t)))
#+END_SRC

For some  reason in some  situations Emacs asks  for typing =yes=  or =no=
explicitly, instead of accepting =y= or =n=. This can be fixed with this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (fset 'yes-or-no-p 'y-or-n-p)
#+END_SRC

Emacs displays pressed  key after some time but it's  too fast for me,
because I use Emacs on the phone  too, and the keyboard is a bit small
for lightning fast typing.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-init-hook (lambda () (setq echo-keystrokes 5)))
#+END_SRC

I don't want menus on shift clicks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-unset-key (kbd "S-<down-mouse-1>"))
  (global-unset-key (kbd "<mouse-3>"))
  (global-unset-key (kbd "S-<mouse-3>"))
#+END_SRC

I  don't like  how  Emacs  handles scrolling,  and  that  it uses  tab
characters by default.  I need tab  characters only when I work with C
code and Makefile rules.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default indent-tabs-mode nil
                scroll-step 1
                scroll-conservatively 10000
                auto-window-vscroll nil)
#+END_SRC

I  don't like  custom,  and  especially would  like  to  stop it  from
interfering to  my configuration  files, so lets  move it  to separate
file.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq custom-file (expand-file-name "custom.el" user-emacs-directory))
  (load custom-file :noerror)
#+END_SRC

I'm not sure why it isn't default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (savehist-mode 1)
#+END_SRC

I use two keyboard layouts: =qwerty=  and =йцукен=, therefore I need a way
to switch between those without loosing  ability to use such chords as
=C-x=  which will  become  a =C-ч=  if  I select  Cyrillic  layout in  the
OS. Luckily for  me, Emacs provides a method to  switch layouts within
Emacs with =C-\=, so all common shortcuts will still work fine.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq default-input-method 'russian-computer)
#+END_SRC

I'm  not   using  =russian-jcuken=   here  because  it   represents  the
"typewriter" layout with number-line inverted,  so to access numbers I
need to use Shift key. =russian-computer= doesn't have this problem.

I  don't  find displaying  position  in  modeline really  great  idea,
because I need to move my eyes too much on big screen just to see what
line number I'm currently on.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq column-number-mode nil
        line-number-mode nil
        size-indication-mode nil
        mode-line-position nil)
#+END_SRC

I don't  want my files to  contain trailing whitespaces, so  this hook
will get rid of those automatically for me.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'before-save-hook 'delete-trailing-whitespace)
#+END_SRC

One thing  that bothered  me is  that =C-g= is  universal way  to cancel
things  in  Emacs, gut  you  have  to be  in  exact  window to  cancel
action.  This function  intelligently  tries to  cancel regardless  of
active window:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  ;; suppress byte-compiler warnings
  (declare-function minibuffer-keyboard-quit "delsel" (&optional ARGS))

  (defun my/escape ()
    "Quit in current context.

  When there is an active minibuffer and we are not inside it close
  it.  When we are inside the minibuffer use the regular
  `minibuffer-keyboard-quit' which quits any active region before
  exiting.  When there is no minibuffer `keyboard-quit' unless we
  are defining or executing a macro."
    (interactive)
    (cond ((active-minibuffer-window)
           (if (minibufferp)
               (minibuffer-keyboard-quit)
             (abort-recursive-edit)))
          (t
           ;; ignore top level quits for macros
           (unless (or defining-kbd-macro executing-kbd-macro)
             (keyboard-quit)))))
#+END_SRC

Let's remap default =keyboard-quit= key with this function.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (global-set-key [remap keyboard-quit] #'my/escape)
#+END_SRC

** Use Package
I use =use-package= to install, load  and configure my packages.  I find
this way very consistent and easy  to understand and maintain.  What I
like about Use  Package is that it automatically  installs packages on
Emacs startup. But  unfortunately it can't be installed  by itself, so
we need  a way to install  Use Package in  case I load this  config on
fresh system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/ensure-installed (package)
    "Ensure that PACKAGE is installed."
    (when (not (package-installed-p package))
      (package-install package)))
#+END_SRC

Now we can install and configure Use Package itself:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (my/ensure-installed 'use-package)
  (require 'use-package)
  (setq use-package-always-ensure t)
#+END_SRC

All  other packages  were  split to  individual  categories much  like
Emacs  settings above.  This  helps  me to  keep  track  of things  in
different packages and do not rely on search that much.

** User Interface
All user interface related settings are presented in this section. I'm
big fan of  DOOM themes, and modeline,  so I'll refer to  them quite a
lot here.

*** Default tweaks
Emacs displays splash screen once started  with no files. I don't need
it, and  I would like to  start with =*scratch*= buffer  instead. Also I
would  like =*scratch*=  buffer  to be  an Org  buffer  with no  initial
message:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq inhibit-splash-screen t
        initial-major-mode 'org-mode
        initial-scratch-message "")
#+END_SRC

I don't need  all these tooltips, menus and  scrollbars. Emacs enables
all of those by default, so let's disable them as early as possible:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (tooltip-mode -1)
  (menu-bar-mode -1)
  (fset 'menu-bar-open nil)

  (when window-system
    (scroll-bar-mode -1)
    (tool-bar-mode -1))
#+END_SRC

Also let's  use bar  cursor when  in window  system, which  is visible
only in active window:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
    (when window-system
      (setq-default cursor-type 'bar
                    cursor-in-non-selected-windows nil))
#+END_SRC

Emacs uses weird method of naming a window, I'd like to see a file I'm
currently working  on in the task  bar in case my  Emacs was minimized
for some reason.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default frame-title-format '("%b — Emacs"))
#+END_SRC

Also,  why initial  frame size  is so  small? When  I launch  Emacs in
terminal it  occupies whole window.  When I launch it  under graphical
environment it defaults to really  small window, which is smaller than
my   terminal.  My   window   manager  doesn't   adjust  window   size
automatically so let's just set little bit bigger initial size:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (set-frame-size (selected-frame) 190 52))
#+END_SRC

With this size I'm  able to fire up Emacs and get  enough space to fit
two vertically aligned windows and a file explorer together.

I like this  Adobe Source Code Pro  font. Even if I use  Hack in every
other editor, for some reason I find this font just right for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (set-face-attribute 'default nil :font "Source Code Pro-10")
#+END_SRC

I want fringes  to appear only in certain buffers  where I really need
them, so let's  disable it entirely on startup and  set them with some
hooks later.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (fringe-mode 0))
#+END_SRC

But this adds another problem. Emacs displays =$= sign at the end of the
window if line is being truncated. Damn,  why it is so hard to make it
work how I want.. And you can't simply set =standard-display-table= slot
to empty space, because it isn't ready on Emacs init.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (or standard-display-table
        (setq standard-display-table (make-display-table)))
    (set-display-table-slot standard-display-table 0 ?\ ))
#+END_SRC

Small  tweak to  mode line,  that disables  changing appearance  in non
active window.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq mode-line-in-non-selected-windows nil)
#+END_SRC

Now  I can  list  some amazing  packages that  provide  some real  GUI
goodies to Emacs.

*** All The Icons
This  package provides  nice icons  for emacs  via custom  fonts. Just
don't forget to use =M-x all-the-icons-install-fonts RET= after install.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package all-the-icons)
#+END_SRC

I don't use  this package directly yet, but some  other packages, like
[[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-doom-themes][DOOM Themes]] do.

*** DOOM Themes
This theme collection  was developed for [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs][DOOM Emacs]], and  I find these
themes actually great  on its own. This package  contains nice variant
of Atom-like One theme which I like,  but it is also an amazingly well
put package, which defines colors for pretty much everything in Emacs.
It also features Treemacs configuration, which  is nice, but I want to
change a little bit of it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-themes
    :commands (doom-themes-org-config
               doom-themes-treemacs-config)

        (unless (require 'all-the-icons nil t)
          (error "`all-the-icons' isn't installed"))

                                     "tpl" "erb" "mustache" "twig" "ejs" "mk" "haml" "pug" "jade")))
    (setq doom-themes-enable-bold t
          doom-themes-enable-italic t))
#+END_SRC

Emacs uses  white titlebar, but  since I'm  using dark color  scheme I
want title bar  to be dark as  well. It is quite  difficult to achieve
this in GNOME Shell, but I found this code [[https://nicolas.petton.fr/blog/emacs-dark-window-decoration.html][on the internet]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/set-frame-dark (&optional frame)
    "Set FRAME titlebar colorscheme to dark variant."
    (with-selected-frame (or frame (selected-frame))
      (call-process-shell-command
       (concat "xprop -f _GTK_THEME_VARIANT 8u -set"
               " _GTK_THEME_VARIANT \"dark\" -name \""
               (frame-parameter frame 'name)
               "\""))))
#+END_SRC

So  if  I  use  =window-system=  I want  this  function  to  run  during
initialization process, and when new frame is created.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (my/set-frame-dark)
    (add-hook 'after-make-frame-functions 'my/set-frame-dark :after))
#+END_SRC

There's also another  great package that adds nice  colors for buffers
that are actually used for editing files: [[https://github.com/hlissner/emacs-solaire-mode][Solaire Mode]].

*** Solaire Mode
This  package helps  distinguish  buffers that  have  file opened  and
buffers that  are for utilities  like file  browser. Also it  has cool
name! =\[T]/=

I really want  Solaire to treat =*scratch*= buffer as  real.  For that I
need to define my  own function that will decide if  buffer is real or
not:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/real-buffer-p ()
    "Determines whether buffer is real."
    (or (and (not (minibufferp))
             (buffer-file-name))
        (string-equal (buffer-name) "*scratch*")))
#+END_SRC

Now  we  can  set  up  Solaire Mode  and  assign  =my/real-buffer-p=  to
=solaire-mode-real-buffer-fn=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package solaire-mode
    :commands (solaire-global-mode
               solaire-mode-swap-bg
               turn-on-solaire-mode
               solaire-mode-in-minibuffer
               solaire-mode-reset)
    :config
    (add-hook 'focus-in-hook #'solaire-mode-reset)
    (add-hook 'after-revert-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode)
    (add-hook 'change-major-mode-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode)
    (add-hook 'org-capture-mode-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode :after)
    (add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook #'turn-on-solaire-mode :after)
    :init
    (setq solaire-mode-real-buffer-fn #'my/real-buffer-p)
    (solaire-global-mode +1)
    (solaire-mode-swap-bg))
#+END_SRC

If only  certain buffers  could +be so  grossly incandescent+  *have damn
fringes!* With  this package  Emacs becomes way  more like  true editor
with  actual   graphical  interface,   but  these  fringes   drive  me
crazy. That's why I wrote this  function, that enables fringes only in
buffers that are affected by Solaire Mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/real-buffer-setup (&rest _)
    "Wrapper around `set-window-fringes' function."
    (when (my/real-buffer-p)
      (set-window-fringes nil 8 8 nil)
      (setq scroll-margin 3)))
#+END_SRC

Let's assign it to these hooks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'window-configuration-change-hook 'my/real-buffer-setup)
  (add-hook 'org-capture-mode-hook 'my/real-buffer-setup)
  (add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook 'my/real-buffer-setup)
#+END_SRC

Now my  buffers looks  really nice, but  my modeline  doesn't. Luckily
there's another great package from DOOM Emacs - [[https://github.com/hlissner/doom-modeline][DOOM Modeline]].

*** DOOM Modeline
I've tried bunch of different modelines:

- [[https://github.com/TheBB/spaceline][Spaceline]]
  Great modeline, but I was  experiencing slowdowns in Emacs startup,
  and I like my Emacs to start fast.
- [[https://github.com/dbordak/telephone-line][Telephone Line]]
  Another good modeline, but I was lazy to configure it.
- [[https://github.com/milkypostman/powerline][Powerline]]
  This was first what I tried because I was using something similar in
  Vim. I don't remember why I dropped it.
- [[https://github.com/tarsius/moody][Moody]]
  Really lightweight  configuration for  default modeline,  which I've
  used for quite a some time.

They're all  great, but  I esperienced some  troubles with  DOOM Theme
that I use,  so I've decided to  try out DOOM Modeline.  And turns out
it's great!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package doom-modeline
    :commands (doom-modeline-mode
               doom-modeline-set-selected-window)
    :init (doom-modeline-mode 1)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-path nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'normal)
    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-buffer-file nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :weight 'semi-bold)

    (set-face-attribute 'doom-modeline-bar nil :foreground (doom-color 'fg) :background (doom-color 'bg-alt) :weight 'normal)
    :config
    (advice-add #'select-window :after #'doom-modeline-set-selected-window)
    (setq doom-modeline-bar-width 3
          doom-modeline-major-mode-color-icon nil
          doom-modeline-buffer-file-name-style 'file-name
          doom-modeline-minor-modes t
          find-file-visit-truename t))
#+END_SRC

I guess that this is all for DOOM  packages for now, but I have to say
that I really  appreciate *[[https://github.com/hlissner][@hlissner]]* work. These  packages already make
Emacs look  outstanding. But to make  it look more like  a traditional
modern text editor we need a  file explorer. Emacs has builtin package
for this, named  =speedbar=, but It uses external frame  and has so many
features  that I  don't  know  if I  really  need. Thankfully  there's
another package that provides filetree: [[https://github.com/Alexander-Miller/treemacs][Treemacs]].

*** Treemacs
With this package, and its supplement packages I can have a consistent
filetree inside my Emacs frame. Which  is good. But there's more: DOOM
Themes support  this package as  well, which means that  Treemacs will
look just as great as DOOM themed Emacs!

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package treemacs
    :commands (treemacs
               treemacs-follow-mode
               treemacs-filewatch-mode
               treemacs-fringe-indicator-mode
               doom-color
               doom-modeline-focus
               treemacs-TAB-action)
    :bind (("<f8>" . treemacs)
           ("<f9>" . treemacs-select-window))
    :config
    (set-face-attribute 'treemacs-root-face nil
                        :foreground (doom-color 'fg)
                        :height 1.0
                        :weight 'normal)
    :init
    (add-hook 'treemacs-mode-hook
              (lambda ()
                (setq line-spacing 4)))
    (setq treemacs-width 27
          treemacs-is-never-other-window t
          treemacs-space-between-root-nodes nil)
    (treemacs-follow-mode t)
    (treemacs-filewatch-mode t)
    (treemacs-fringe-indicator-mode nil)
    (when window-system
      (treemacs)
      (treemacs-TAB-action)))
#+END_SRC

This supplement  package makes  some nice integration  with Projectile
package that I'm using. It doesn't really need any configuration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package treemacs-projectile)
#+END_SRC

Same story with Magit integration.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package treemacs-magit)
#+END_SRC

Before using Treemacs I was a  happy user of another filetree package:
[[https://github.com/jaypei/emacs-neotree][Neotree]]. Unfortunately, last  commit to this package dates  to Nov 21,
2018, and since then there were no maintenance, and I was experiencing
a bug which  affects my usage of another amazing  package [[https://github.com/wasamasa/eyebrowse][Eyebrowse]] so
I've decided to move to Treemacs, since it works fine with it.

*** Eyebrowse
This  package imitates  virtual workspaces,  or virtual  frames inside
single Emacs  frame. This  is really  useful, when  you have  bunch of
windows, and you  want to open new  set but don't want  to loose other
window configurations. It works much like Vim tabs, or Tmux windows.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package eyebrowse
    :commands eyebrowse-mode
    :init
    (eyebrowse-mode t))
#+END_SRC

*** Diff HL Mode
This package  provides nice way  of diffing buffers. It  displays thin
bar inside fringe marking unstaged changes.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package diff-hl
    :commands global-diff-hl-mode
    :init
    (add-hook 'diff-hl-mode-hook #'my/setup-fringe-bitmaps)
    (add-hook 'magit-post-refresh-hook 'diff-hl-magit-post-refresh)
    (global-diff-hl-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

But I don't quite  like how it looks. So there's  another thing that I
borrowed from DOOM Emacs configuration. This function sets fringe diff
highlighting bitmaps to get nice looking thin vertical bars which play
nicely with DOOM Themes and DOOM Modeline:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/setup-fringe-bitmaps ()
    "Set fringe bitmaps."
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-top [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-middle [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-bottom [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-insert [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-single [224] nil nil '(center repeated))
    (define-fringe-bitmap 'diff-hl-bmp-delete [240 224 192 128] nil nil 'top))

#+END_SRC

Speaking of defining fancier things.  This configuration is written in
Org Mode, so maybe we could  have nice symbols for headings? Of course
we can, there's a package for it: [[https://github.com/sabof/org-bullets][Org Bullets]].

*** Org Bullets
This package makes org headings use  fancy bullet symbols. But I don't
quite like those, so I set them to these four symbols: =◉=, =○=, =•=, =◦=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package org-bullets
    :commands org-bullets-mode
    :config
    (setq-default org-bullets-bullet-list
                  '("◉" "○" "•" "◦" "◦" "◦" "◦" "◦" "◦" "◦" "◦"))
    :init
    (when window-system
      (add-hook 'org-mode-hook (lambda () (org-bullets-mode 1)))))
#+END_SRC

*** Minions
This  package  implements   a  menu  that  lists   all  enabled  minor
modes. Emacs mode  line can become pretty long, so  this can be handy,
and perhaps I don't need to use =:diminish= everywhere anymore.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package minions
    :commands minions-mode
    :config (setq minions-direct '(multiple-cursors-mode
                                   flycheck-mode
                                   flyspell-mode
                                   parinfer-mode))
    :init (minions-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Eldoc Box
A package that creates child frame for eldoc documentation messages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package eldoc-box
    :commands eldoc-box-hover-mode
    :config
    (set-face-attribute 'eldoc-box-border nil :background "#191B20")
    :init
    (advice-add 'eldoc-box-hover-mode :after 'eldoc-box-hover-at-point-mode)
    (add-hook 'eglot--managed-mode-hook #'eldoc-box-hover-mode t)
    (setq eldoc-box-max-pixel-width 1920
          eldoc-box-max-pixel-height 1080))
#+END_SRC

*** Window Divider
This package changes  window dividers appearance.  I want  to set them
to be  only 1 pixel  wide because if this  mode is turned  on, fringes
don't loose 1 pixel of width.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when window-system
    (setq window-divider-default-right-width 1)
    (window-divider-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

** Modes
In Emacs  world Modes  are the  main thing. I'm  using Org  Mode quite
heavily right now, as well as  a lot of other modes. Configurations of
these modes are stored here.

*** Org Mode
Org  Mode is  a great  mode for  taking notes,  managing to-do  lists,
writing books, literate programming, and  many other things. I primary
use it for taking notes on different programming languages, and manage
my Emacs configuration with it.

**** Startup Settings
For Org  Mode I  need spell  checking to be  enabled by  default. Also
Org-mode plays nicely with justification, so I'll set it to =full=, as I
think that it  is the most appropriate format for  text. Org files are
capable of displaying images, so let's enable them by default. There's
also  a nice  mode called  =org-indent-mode=  that makes  easier to  see
different sub-trees.  Speaking of sub-trees, =org-startup-folded= can be
set to ='content=, so every document will look like table of contents by
default. Last but not least, let's enable =auto-fill-mode= for org mode,
so all text will be folded  and re-filled after its length reaches the
=fill-column= value.  document

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'org)
  (add-hook 'org-mode-hook
            (lambda()
              (flyspell-mode)
              (setq default-justification 'full
                    org-startup-with-inline-images t
                    org-startup-folded 'content
                    org-hide-emphasis-markers t
                    org-adapt-indentation nil
                    org-hide-leading-stars t
                    org-highlight-latex-and-related '(latex)
                    revert-without-query '(".*\.pdf"))
              (auto-fill-mode)
              (set-face-attribute 'org-document-title nil :height 1.6)
              (set-face-attribute 'org-level-1        nil :height 1.4)
              (set-face-attribute 'org-level-2        nil :height 1.2)
              (set-face-attribute 'org-level-3        nil :height 1.0)))
#+END_SRC

This will fontify code inside =SRC_BLOCK= sections:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-src-fontify-natively t)
#+END_SRC

**** Source Code Blocks
Since I'm using Emacs to configure Emacs, I want flycheck to run while
I'm editing =emacs-lisp= source blocks. But I find it distracting to see
warnings like =;;; Code=, so let's disable it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar flycheck-disabled-checkers)

  (defun my/disable-flycheck-in-org-src-block ()
    "Disable checkdoc in emacs-lisp buffers."
    (setq-local flycheck-disabled-checkers '(emacs-lisp-checkdoc)))
#+END_SRC

Now we need to call this function when editing source blocks:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'org-src-mode-hook 'my/disable-flycheck-in-org-src-block)
#+END_SRC

I often  edit my configuration,  so it would  be cool to  update Emacs
config automatically on save. This function will handle it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/org-tangle-on-config-save ()
    "Tangle source code blocks when configuration file is saved."
    (when (string= buffer-file-name (file-truename "~/.emacs.d/config.org"))
      (org-babel-tangle)
      (byte-compile-file "~/.emacs.d/init.el")))
#+END_SRC

To actually make it work we need to add this hook:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'after-save-hook 'my/org-tangle-on-config-save)
#+END_SRC

**** Inline Images
Since Org-mode allows inline images, we  need a way to update them, if
image changes for some reason.  We will use hook to call this function
is supposed to automatically update inline images in org buffers, when
for some reason image was changed.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar org-inline-image-overlays)

  (defun my/org-update-inline-images ()
    "Update inline images in Org-mode."
    (when org-inline-image-overlays
      (org-redisplay-inline-images)))

  (add-hook 'org-babel-after-execute-hook 'my/org-update-inline-images)
#+END_SRC

***** Inline LaTeX Preview
Latex preview  feature is  really awesome, but  I don't  want produced
images to be stored in plain sight. At least use hidden folder.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-preview-latex-image-directory ".ltximg/")
#+END_SRC

**** Org Mappings
I don't like  that my =S-tab= mapping for  Company triggers =org-shifftab=
function, so I'll remap it to use =C-tab= instead.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (define-key org-mode-map [backtab] nil)
  (define-key org-mode-map [S-iso-lefttab] nil)
  (define-key org-mode-map [C-tab] nil)
  (define-key org-mode-map [C-tab] 'org-shifttab)
#+END_SRC

**** Syntax Highlighting in Exported PDFs
To  highlight code  blocks  when  exporting to  LaTeX  we need  =minted=
package   installed   system-wide   and    this   code   (taken   from
[[https://emacs.stackexchange.com/questions/20839/exporting-code-blocks-to-pdf-via-latex/20841#20841][emacs.stackexchange.com]]):

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-latex)
  (setq org-latex-listings 'minted)
#+END_SRC

Minted creates annoying directories  named =_minted-documentname=, and I
don't want  them to  be in plain  sight.  So this  code here  will put
those directories to temporary folder on my system.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar minted-cache-dir
    (file-name-as-directory
     (expand-file-name ".minted/\\jombname"
                       temporary-file-directory)))

  (add-to-list 'org-latex-packages-alist
               `(,(concat "cachedir=" minted-cache-dir)
                 "minted" nil))
#+END_SRC

Now we need  to tell =pdflatex= to use these  escape sequence for proper
colors. This part is worth checking  for a more proper way of handling
highlighting, because right  now code blocks written  in language that
=minted= doesn't  support will  not be  exported to PDF  at all.   But I
don't know how to fix this.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-latex-pdf-process
        '("pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"
          "pdflatex -shell-escape -interaction nonstopmode -output-directory %o %f"))
#+END_SRC

**** Cleanup After Export
Since I'm exporting my notes to PDF as final file format, I don't need
intermediary =.tex= file to stay.  Let's assume that these files are log
files, so Org mode will remove those after exporting is finished.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (eval-after-load 'org
    '(add-to-list 'org-latex-logfiles-extensions "tex"))
#+END_SRC

This will get rid of =.tex= files.

**** Executable Languages
A nice feature of Org-mode over Markdown is that we can execute source
code  blocks with  a keybinding  and see  results inside  the document
itself.   Let's define  what languages  can be  executed with  =C-c C-c=
shortcut from org mode:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (org-babel-do-load-languages
   'org-babel-load-languages
   '((gnuplot . t)
     (scheme . t)))
#+END_SRC

And  to prevent  Emacs from  constantly asking  if I  want to  execute
source code, lets set =org-confirm-babel-evaluate= to =nil=

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq org-confirm-babel-evaluate nil)
#+END_SRC

**** Paragraphs
I would like to use the same level headings after certain part, so all
my   deeply   nested   notes   contained   right   section   separator
headings. This is a hacky way but it works:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'org-latex-classes
               '("article"
                 "\\documentclass{article}"
                 ("\\section{%s}" . "\\section*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsection{%s}" . "\\subsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")
                 ("\\subsubsection{%s}" . "\\subsubsection*{%s}")))

**** Markdown Export
I don't  think that I gonna  use this much,  but just in case  if I'll
ever decide to export Org to Markdown, I'll need this:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (require 'ox-md nil t)
#+END_SRC

*** Flycheck Mode
Flycheck  is useful  tool, which  can provide  syntax checking  on the
fly. Let's enable it for bunch of languages here.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook 'flycheck-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** Doc View Mode
Default resolution is too low:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default doc-view-resolution 192)
#+END_SRC

*** Display Line Numbers Mode
This mode provides line numbers on  the left side of the window, which
doesn't lag. I don't like that it changes width, so let's change it:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (setq-default display-line-numbers-grow-only t
                display-line-numbers-width-start t)
#+END_SRC

*** Prog Mode
This isn't really a configuration of  Prog Mode itself, but some hooks
that change how programming related modes behave.

Here, I want all programming modes to include line numbers by default:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'display-line-numbers-mode)
#+END_SRC

One feature that I think  is really important, especially when working
with lisp code, is ability to  see matching bracket when cursor stands
near the other bracket. So I enable it for every programming language.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'prog-mode-hook 'show-paren-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** CC Mode
These settings are for editing C source files. First, to suppress byte
compilation warning lets declare variables:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defvar c-basic-offset)
  (defvar c-default-style)
#+END_SRC

Now we can create a hook that will run for all C related modes:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'c-mode-common-hook
            (lambda ()
              (yas-minor-mode)
              (electric-pair-mode)
              (setq c-basic-offset 4
                    c-default-style "linux"
                    indent-tabs-mode t
                    tab-width 4)))
#+END_SRC

*** Markdown
Sometimes I need to edit Markdown documents, so this package is handy.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package markdown-mode
    :mode (("README\\.md\\'" . gfm-mode)
           ("\\.md\\'" . markdown-mode)
           ("\\.markdown\\'" . markdown-mode))
    :init (defvar markdown-command "multimarkdown"))
#+END_SRC

For markdown  mode I would like  to have automatic spell  checking and
filling. Basically the same setup as for Org Mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (add-hook 'markdown-mode-hook
            '(lambda()
               (flyspell-mode)
               (setq fill-column 80
                     default-justification 'left)
               (auto-fill-mode)))

#+END_SRC

*** Rust
I'd like to  have Rust syntax highlighting and  some basic facilities,
since I'm  planning to write my  exercises in org mode.   Since I make
notes in Org-mode, and  I started to use it for Rust  too, I need some
settings for Rust mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package rust-mode
    :config (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook
                      '(lambda()
                         (racer-mode)
                         (yas-minor-mode)
                         (electric-pair-mode)
                         (setq company-tooltip-align-annotations t))))
#+END_SRC

This also means  that I could use something  to automatically complete
Rust  language facilities.  Rust  ecosystem provides  two options  for
that:  Racer, and  RLS.  I'm  planning to  use  Racer  when RLS  isn't
possible to use, like in Org Mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package racer
    :config (add-hook 'racer-mode-hook #'eldoc-mode))
#+END_SRC

There's also a package for Cargo integration:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package cargo
    :config
    (add-hook 'rust-mode-hook 'cargo-minor-mode))
#+END_SRC

*** TOML
=toml-mode= helps  with highlighting of  TOML files, which Rust  uses to
configure project.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package toml-mode)
#+END_SRC

*** EditorConfig
Speaking  of formatting,  =.editorconfig= file  provides a  nice way  to
synchronize my  editor configurations  between projects  and different
editors.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package editorconfig
    :commands editorconfig-mode
    :config
    (editorconfig-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Nov.el
Package that  makes it  possible to read  [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EPUB][ePUB]] formatted  books inside
Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package nov
    :commands nov-mode
    :functions solaire-mode
    :mode "\\.epub$"
    :init
    (setq nov-text-width 80)
    (add-hook 'nov-mode-hook #'visual-line-mode)
    (add-hook 'nov-mode-hook #'solaire-mode))
#+END_SRC

** Tools
Additional  packages  that  change  how Emacs  works,  providing  more
comfortable user experience.

*** Hydra
Hydra is  something like ability to  create mappings that sit  in it's
own mode, like different user modes  in Kakoune. It allows me to press
some shortcut and  be locked in a mode-like state  where keys that are
related  to  this  prefix  shortcut  are behaving  in  terms  of  this
shortcut.

This  package will  be used  in many  other package  configurations to
provide sane keybindings.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package hydra
    :commands (hydra-default-pre
               hydra-keyboard-quit
               hydra--call-interactively-remap-maybe
               hydra-show-hint
               hydra-set-transient-map)
    :bind (("<f5>" . hydra-zoom/body))
    :config
    (defhydra hydra-zoom (:hint nil)
      "Scale text"
      ("+" text-scale-increase "in")
      ("-" text-scale-decrease "out")
      ("0" (text-scale-set 0) "reset")))
#+END_SRC

*** Geiser
Since I mostly use Emacs for studying LISP, and I'm reading SICP which
uses Scheme as main LISP flavor for explanations and exercises, I need
a tool  to run Scheme,  and Geiser seems  like the most  viable option
here, since it also provides completion for it.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package geiser
    :config
    (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook 'geiser-mode)
    :init
    (setq-default geiser-active-implementations '(guile)
                  geiser-default-implementation 'guile))
#+END_SRC

*** Parinfer
Now that's a quality package. It makes writing LISP so easy, that I've
never thought it could be.

There's  a lot  of configuration  here, but  it was  taken as  is from
Parinfer Mode repository.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package parinfer
    :commands parinfer-mode
    :bind
    (("C-," . parinfer-toggle-mode))
    :init
    (progn
      (setq parinfer-extensions
            '(defaults
               pretty-parens
               smart-tab
               smart-yank))
      (add-hook 'clojure-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'emacs-lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'common-lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'scheme-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)
      (add-hook 'lisp-mode-hook #'parinfer-mode)))
#+END_SRC

*** Flx
This package provides some kind of fuzzy matching for Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flx)
#+END_SRC

*** Ivy and Counsel
Ivy  is a  narrowing  framework  like Helm,  but  much  lighter in  my
experience.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package ivy
    :commands ivy-mode
    :init
    (setq ivy-use-virtual-buffers t
          enable-recursive-minibuffers t)
    :bind (("C-x C-b" . ivy-switch-buffer)
           ("C-x b" . ivy-switch-buffer))
    :config
    (setq ivy-re-builders-alist '((t . ivy--regex-fuzzy))
          ivy-count-format ""
          ivy-display-style nil
          ivy-minibuffer-faces nil)
    (ivy-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

It integrates with  Counsel that handles minibuffer,  so let's install
it too. I'm  using [[https://github.com/sharkdp/fd][fd]] as a  great replacement for GNU  Find. It's fast
and  it   takes  =.gitignore=   into  account.    Let's  assign   it  to
=find-program=.  /I guess there will be  no problems/ /if a well known tool
is replaced  by something  that is completely  different, am  I right?/
Well I hope that it is used by =grep.el= only.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (when (executable-find "fd")
    (setq find-program "fd"))
#+END_SRC

Counsel  has nice  =counsel-file-fump=  command  that uses  =find-program=
variable, so it will be more performant with =fd=.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package counsel
    :init (when (executable-find "fd")
            (setq counsel-file-jump-args "-L --type f --hidden"))
    (setq counsel-rg-base-command "rg -S --no-heading --hidden --line-number --color never %s .")
    :bind (("M-x" . counsel-M-x)
           ("C-x C-f" . counsel-find-file)
           ("C-x p" . counsel-file-jump)
           ("C-x C-r" . counsel-recentf)
           ("C-c g" . counsel-git-grep)
           ("C-c r" . counsel-rg)
           ("C-h f" . counsel-describe-function)
           ("C-h v" . counsel-describe-variable)
           ("C-h l" . counsel-find-library)))
#+END_SRC

*** Flycheck
A really  nice linting package that  helps me track errors  in most of
languages.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package flycheck)
#+END_SRC

**** Flycheck Rust
This package makes flycheck work with Rust projects.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package flycheck-rust
     :commands (flycheck-rust-setup)
     :init (with-eval-after-load 'rust-mode
             (add-hook 'flycheck-mode-hook #'flycheck-rust-setup)))
 #+END_SRC

*** Company
Complete anything framework. Nothing much to say. Does it's job.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company
    :bind (:map company-active-map
                ("TAB" . company-complete-common-or-cycle)
                ("<tab>" . company-complete-common-or-cycle)
                ("<S-Tab>" . company-select-previous)
                ("<backtab>" . company-select-previous))
    :init
    (add-hook 'after-init-hook 'global-company-mode)
    (setq company-require-match 'never
          company-minimum-prefix-length 3
          company-tooltip-align-annotations t
          company-frontends
          '(company-pseudo-tooltip-unless-just-one-frontend
            company-preview-frontend
            company-echo-metadata-frontend))
    :config
    (setq company-backends (remove 'company-clang company-backends)
          company-backends (remove 'company-xcode company-backends)
          company-backends (remove 'company-cmake company-backends)
          company-backends (remove 'company-gtags company-backends)))
#+END_SRC

**** Company FLX
Fuzzy matching for company.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package company-flx
   :commands company-flx-mode
   :init (with-eval-after-load 'company
           (company-flx-mode +1)))
#+END_SRC

*** Undo Tree
This is more familiar  undo mode. It adds =C-/= mapping  to undo and =C-?=
mapping to redo.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package undo-tree
    :commands global-undo-tree-mode
    :init
    (global-undo-tree-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Yasnippet
Another very handy package, that helps insert templates of code. Now I
really need to write some snippets to use...

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet
    :commands yas-reload-all
    :init (yas-reload-all))
#+END_SRC

**** Yasnippet Snippets
A enormous snippet collection for yasnippet.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package yasnippet-snippets)
#+END_SRC

*** Projectile
Since Emacs  is stupid, it  changes working directory to  current file
location. So I need a whole plugin to workaround this silly issue.

However this plugin is quite useful with Git repositories.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package projectile
    :commands (projectile-mode
               projectile-find-file
               projectile-project-root)
    :defines (my/projectile-project-find-function)
    :bind (("C-c p" . projectile-command-map))
    :init
    (with-eval-after-load 'project
      (defvar project-find-functions)
      (add-to-list 'project-find-functions
                   #'my/projectile-project-find-function))
    (projectile-mode +1)
    (setq projectile-svn-command "fd -L --type f --print0"
          projectile-generic-command "fd -L --type f --print0"
          projectile-require-project-root t
          projectile-enable-caching t
          projectile-completion-system 'ivy))
#+END_SRC

There's still one problem though. I'm using Projectile, but some other
packages, like [[Eglot]]  use =project.el=.  Which means that  all nice root
detection handled by  projectile is bypassed and all  attempts to find
roots of the  project are not exactly where the  project root actually
is. This  function attempts to fix  this problem.  I found  it in this
issue [[https://github.com/joaotavora/eglot/issues/129][joaotavora/eglot#129]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (defun my/projectile-project-find-function (dir)
    "Handle root search in DIR with Projectile."
    (unless (require 'projectile nil t)
      (error "`projectile' isn't installed"))
    (let ((root (projectile-project-root dir)))
      (and root (cons 'transient root))))
#+END_SRC

**** Counsel projectile
It makes using projectile easier by allowing fuzzy matching.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package counsel-projectile
    :commands counsel-projectile-mode
    :config (counsel-projectile-mode))
#+END_SRC

*** Magit
Magit is a Emacs  interface to Git.  I've heard that  it has many nice
features, so I want to try it out.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package magit)
#+END_SRC

*** Vdiff
=vdiff= is a package, that works similar to Vimdiff.  Ediff isn't really
comfortable to  use, and vdiff also  has integration with [[*Magit][Magit]],  so I
gonna try it out.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package vdiff
    :init (setq vdiff-lock-scrolling t
                vdiff-diff-algorithm 'diff
                vdiff-disable-folding nil
                vdiff-min-fold-size 4
                vdiff-subtraction-style 'full
                vdiff-subtraction-fill-char ?\ )
    :config
    (define-key vdiff-mode-map (kbd "C-c") vdiff-mode-prefix-map)
    (set-face-attribute 'vdiff-subtraction-face nil :background "#4F343A" :foreground "#F36868")
    (set-face-attribute 'vdiff-addition-face nil :background "#3E493D" :foreground "#98BE65")
    (set-face-attribute 'vdiff-change-face nil :background "#293239" :foreground "#4f97d7")
    (add-hook 'vdiff-mode-hook #'outline-show-all))
#+END_SRC

**** Vdiff Magit
=vdiff-magit= is  a supplement  package, that provides  integration with
[[*Magit][Magit]] package.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package vdiff-magit
    :commands (vdiff-magit-dwim vdiff-magit)
    :functions (transient-suffix-put)
    :bind (:map magit-mode-map
                ("e" . 'vdiff-magit-dwim)
                ("E" . 'vdiff-magit))
    :init
    (setq vdiff-magit-stage-is-2way t)
    (transient-suffix-put 'magit-dispatch "e" :description "vdiff (dwim)")
    (transient-suffix-put 'magit-dispatch "e" :command 'vdiff-magit-dwim)
    (transient-suffix-put 'magit-dispatch "E" :description "vdiff")
    (transient-suffix-put 'magit-dispatch "E" :command 'vdiff-magit)
    (advice-add 'vdiff-magit-dwim :before 'eyebrowse-create-window-config))
#+END_SRC

*** Which Key
=which-key=  is a  package that  can show  all possible  completions for
keyboard shortcuts in a popup menu. I'm still learning Emacs, so let's
enable it by default.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package which-key
    :commands which-key-mode
    :init
    (which-key-mode))
#+END_SRC

*** Multiple Cursors
This  package provides  multiple cursors  functionality to  Emacs.  It
isn't much like Kakoune's multiple selections, but anything will do. I
guess I'll figure out best mappings over time.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package multiple-cursors
    :commands (mc/cycle-backward
               mc/cycle-forward)
    :bind (("S-<mouse-1>" . mc/add-cursor-on-click)
           ("C-c m" . hydra-mc/body))
    :config (defhydra hydra-mc (:hint nil)

              ("C" mc/mark-next-lines)
              ("q" mc/remove-duplicated-cursors :exit t)))
#+END_SRC

**** MC Extras
this package provides  some extra functions for  multiple cursors. I'm
interested in  =mc/remove-duplicaded-cursors=. When using [[*Phi  Search][Phi Search]] it
often  places several  cursors at  the same  positions, which  I don't
like.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package mc-extras
    :config
    (advice-add 'phi-search :after 'mc/remove-duplicated-cursors))
#+END_SRC

*** Iedit
This  is nice  package  that provides  something  similar to  multiple
cursors, but  it's not actually multiple  cursors. I'd like to  use it
when I  know that  multiple cursors  will cause  lot of  overhead. But
unfortunately  =iedit-mode=  automatically  selects all  occurrences  in
current buffer, which can be a  *lot* of occurrences. To prevent this, I
wrote =my/iedit-select-current-or-add= function,  that enters =iedit-mode=
and immediately restricts  it to current line, after  that removes all
occurrences before and  after current. I know, that /Ctrl  + d/ is bound
to =delete-char=, but  I rarely use it,  and I already built  a habit to
use this shortcut  to add multiple cursors. With the  function above I
can use Iedit for that.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package iedit
    :commands (iedit-expand-down-to-occurrence
               iedit-restrict-current-line

    :init
    (defun my/iedit-select-current-or-add ()
      "Select only current occurrence with `iedit-mode'.  Expand to
  next occurrence if iedit mode is already active."

            (iedit-goto-last-occurrence)
            (iedit-toggle-selection))

This package allows to expand  or reduce region selection semantically
in most languages that I work with inside Emacs.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package expand-region
    :commands (er/expand-region
               er/mark-paragraph
               er/mark-inside-pairs
               er/mark-outside-pairs
               er/mark-inside-quotes
               er/mark-outside-quotes
               er/contract-region)
    :bind (("C-c e" . hydra-er/body))
    :config (defhydra hydra-er (:hint nil)
              "

              ("e" er/expand-region :post hydra-er/body)
              ("-" er/contract-region :post hydra-er/body)
              ("p" er/mark-paragraph)
              ("(" er/mark-inside-pairs)
              (")" er/mark-outside-pairs)
              ("q" er/mark-inside-quotes)
              ("Q" er/mark-outside-quotes)))
#+END_SRC

*** Phi Search
This search mode is compatible with multiple cursors.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package phi-search
    :bind (("C-s" . phi-search)
           ("C-r" . phi-search-backward)))
#+END_SRC

*** Eglot
Emacs polyglot. LSP client.

 #+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
   (use-package eglot
     :commands (eglot eglot-ensure)
     :config
     (add-to-list 'eglot-server-programs '((c-mode c++-mode) "clangd"))
     (add-to-list 'eglot-ignored-server-capabilites :documentHighlightProvider)
     :init
     (add-hook 'c-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure)
     (add-hook 'c++-mode-hook 'eglot-ensure))
#+END_SRC

*** Clang Format
A package to format C code with Clang Format.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package clang-format)
#+END_SRC

*** GCMH
The Garbage Collector Magic Hack.  Enforce aaaa sneaky Garbage Collection
strategy to minimize GC interference with the activity.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gcmh
    :commands gcmh-mode
    :init (gcmh-mode 1))
#+END_SRC

*** GNU Plot
This is aaaa  package needed for making plots with  gnuplot.  Required by
Org mode.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package gnuplot)
#+END_SRC

*** VLF
This package  makes it easier to  view large files in  Emacs. It opens
files in chunks, but still allows to search through file with

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package vlf-setup
    :ensure vlf
    :config (setq vlf-application 'dont-ask))
#+END_SRC

*** Imenu List
Package  somewhat  similar  to  [[https://github.com/vim-scripts/taglist.vim][Taglist]] plugin  in  Vim  or  Kakoune's
[[https://github.com/andreyorst/tagbar.kak][tagbar.kak]].  Uses  =imenu= to  get information,  and since  many plugins
provide =imenu=  data it's  quite useful. I'm  using =advice-add=  here to
disable  modeline  in  =*imenu-list*=   buffer,  also  locking  it  size
preventing it from  changing when I close or resize  other windows. If
we call  this lambda  function with =:after=  advice, the  modeline will
disappear in  another window. With =:after-while=  lambda evaluated only
when =imenu-list= was toggled to be shown.

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (use-package imenu-list
    :defines imenu-list-idle-update-delay-time
    :bind (("<f7>" . imenu-list-smart-toggle))
    :config
    (advice-add 'imenu-list-smart-toggle :after-while
                (lambda()
                  (setq window-size-fixed 'width
                        mode-line-format nil)))
    :init (setq imenu-list-idle-update-delay-time 0.1
                imenu-list-size 27
                imenu-list-focus-after-activation t))
#+END_SRC

* Postscript
This Emacs Configuration features  various cool E-Lisp hacks somewhere
that I've  found over the  Internet, and I  try to keep  references to
original places, so reader could refer to those, because I alter these
pieces of code for my personal needs and thus it may not be compatible
with  other people  tastes,  and  because I  want  to credit  original
author.

If you  find any issue with  my config feel  free to [[https://github.com/andreyorst/dotfiles/issues/new][file an  issue]] or
contact me via email: [[mailto:andreyorst@gmail.com][andreyorst@gmail.com]].

And as aaaa final step of a proper init file:

#+BEGIN_SRC emacs-lisp
  (provide 'init)
  ;;; init.el ends here
#+END_SRC

Thanks for reading!
